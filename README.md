# Option Pricing Tool Using Black-Sholes Model

## Backtest the accuracy of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula on historical stock data

This project was built as part of my studies on mathematical finance. It allows you to do the following:

Historical Pricing page:
* Pull historical stock and option data for your given time frame
* Pull historical interest rate data
* Plot historical theoretical call and put prices against real prices
* Adjust historical volatility hyperparameter
* Test models for "Goodness-of-Fit"

Live-pricing page:
* Stream live stock price
* Calculate live theoretical call and put prices
